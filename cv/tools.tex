\subsection*{Reinforcement Learning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \href{https://rlberry-py.github.io/rlberry/about.html#contributors}{Core contributor to \texttt{rlberry}}: \texttt{PyTorch} implementation of deep reinforcement learning agents. Compatibility with \texttt{stable-baselines3}. Advanced training analysis with robust stats. Usage of git for development and continuous integration.
    \item[] \href{https://github.com/KohlerHECTOR/interpretable-rl-zoo}{Maintainer of a set of fully-transparent control policies for games and robots}: inspired by the \texttt{stable-baselines3-zoo} and the \texttt{gymnasium} API.
    \item[] \href{https://github.com/TimotheeMathieu/adastop}{designed statistical test for the reliable and cheap comparison and benchmarking of RL.}
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \href{https://github.com/KohlerHECTOR/DPDTreeEstimator}{Maintainer of my own \texttt{scikit-learn} estimator}: I developped DPDT, a decision tree induction algorithm which is SOTA for tabular problems. 
\end{itemize}
